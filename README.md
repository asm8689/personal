## Webscraper: ##
I built this tool to scrape key data from business broker websites. Previously, I was tasked with manually 
compiling the following info from the broker sites:
1. Company website
2. Gross Revenue Estimate
3. Listed Price
4. City
5. Owner name
6. Owner email
7. Owner phone #
8. Broker name
9. Broker email
10. Broker phone #

This tool saved me and the other analysts countless number of hours of menial labor. 
*Note* BizBuySell has updated their website and changed/removed tags for certain information, program does not work like it should
